# Python lecture

This repository contains the material for lecture of a [data scientist university degree](https://www.uca.fr/formation/nos-formations/catalogue-des-formations/du-data-scientist-23438.kjsp) proposed at Universit√© Clermont-Auvergne (UCA), which is mostly based on a [NumPy tutorial](https://github.com/MLatCezeaux/intro_numpy) that I gave at the [Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont](http://clrwww.in2p3.fr/) in April 2019.

### Scope of the lecture

**What this lecture is?** A *basic* and *operational* introduction to python together with some of the data analysis tools (numpy, matplotlib, pandas).

**What this lecture isn't?** Neither a formal introduction to python, nor a extensive demonstration of all available features available in the tools mentioned above.

**Goal of the lecture**
