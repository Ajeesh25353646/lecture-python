# Basic python for data analysis

This repository contains the material for lecture of a [data scientist university degree](https://www.uca.fr/formation/nos-formations/catalogue-des-formations/du-data-scientist-23438.kjsp) proposed at Universit√© Clermont-Auvergne (UCA), which is mostly based on a [NumPy tutorial](https://github.com/MLatCezeaux/intro_numpy) that I gave at the [Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont](http://clrwww.in2p3.fr/) in April 2019. No prerequisite knowledge is assumed but being familiar with one progaming language might be useful.


### General scope of the lecture

The main goal of this lecture is to make people familiar with python and data analysis tools in order to make them able to extend their knowledge on *themself*. Partical exercises are also available to provide few working example of quick data manipulation.

**What this lecture is?** A *basic* and *practical* introduction to python together with some of the most important data analysis tools namely `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

**What this lecture isn't?** Neither a formal introduction to python, nor a extensive demonstration of all available features available in the tools mentioned above.
