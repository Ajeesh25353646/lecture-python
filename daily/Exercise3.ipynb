    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "You will study some data related to the usage of a car.  \n",
    "The dataset is located available with the lecture (`data/CarData.csv` in the main directory of the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "Open the file and load it in a DataFrame (with pandas).  \n",
    "List all the variables, their type and some basic information about them (min, mean, std, max, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "Do the histograms and scatter plots of all the float type vaiables.  \n",
    "What can you conclude about how they are distributed and related ?  \n",
    "Hint : Don't hesitate to 'zoom in' to better see the denser parts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "Lets focus on the variables related to the time of travel (hour, day and week).  \n",
    "How are the travels distributed in time ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4\n",
    "Fit the duration VS distance using scipy.  \n",
    "You can split the distance range in two and fit them sepparatetly.\n",
    "Hint : I recommend to use polynomial functions of different degree for the fit.\n",
    "#### Step 5 (optional)\n",
    "Use any tool from scipy to measure the goodness of fit (something like khi2)."
