The basic element of a notebook is a **cell**, which can be either a **code cell** or a **markdown cell** (as seen later in this chapter, *markdown* is a system to format text using raw text only). The creation of a new cell can done using the \"plus\" button in the top menu, the type of the cell (code or markdown) can be selected using the drop-down menu (there are actually more categories but only code and markdown matters).
